In SOS programs, the variables\\n$s(x;P)$ are polynomial in the independent variables $x$, but linear in the\\ndecision variables $P$. Current SOS parsers, however, fail to exploit the\\nsemi-linear structure of the polynomial variables, treating the decision\\nvariables as independent variables in their representation. This results in\\nunnecessary overhead in storage and manipulation of the polynomial variables,\\nprohibiting the parser from addressing larger-scale optimization problems. To\\neliminate this computational overhead, we introduce a new representation of\\npolynomial variables, the \"dpvar\" structure, that is affine in the decision\\nvariables. We show that the complexity of operations on variables in the dpvar\\nrepresentation scales favorably with the number of decision variables. We\\nfurther show that the required memory for storing polynomial variables is\\nrelatively small using the dpvar structure, particularly when exploiting the\\nMATLAB sparse storage structure.

       "  'summary': 'Low-rank matrix estimation under heavy-tailed noise is challenging, both\\ncomputationally and statistically. Convex approaches have been proven\\nstatistically optimal but suffer from high computational costs, especially\\nsince robust loss functions are usually non-smooth. More recently,\\ncomputationally fast non-convex approaches via sub-gradient descent are\\nproposed, which, unfortunately, fail to deliver a statistically consistent\\nestimator even under sub-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we introduce a novel\\nRiemannian sub-gradient (RsGrad) algorithm which is not only computationally\\nefficient with linear convergence but also is statistically optimal, be the\\nnoise Gaussian or heavy-tailed. Convergence theory is established for a general\\nframework and specific applications to absolute loss, Huber loss and quantile\\nloss are investigated. Compared with existing non-convex methods, ours reveals\\na surprising phenomenon of dual-phase convergence. In phase one, RsGrad behaves\\nas in a typical non-smooth optimization that requires gradually decaying\\nstepsizes. However, phase one only delivers a statistically sub-optimal\\nestimator which is already observed in existing literature. Interestingly,\\nduring phase two, RsGrad converges linearly as if minimizing a smooth and\\nstrongly convex objective function and thus a constant stepsize suffices.\\nUnderlying the phase-two convergence is the smoothing effect of random noise to\\nthe non-smooth robust losses in an area close but not too close to the truth.\\nNumerical simulations confirm our theoretical discovery and showcase the\\nsuperiority of RsGrad over prior methods.',\n",

       "  'summary': 'Benders decomposition is one of the most applied methods to solve two-stage\\nstochastic problems (TSSP) with a large number of scenarios. The main idea\\nbehind the Benders decomposition is to solve a large problem by replacing the\\nvalues of the second-stage subproblems with individual variables, and\\nprogressively forcing those variables to reach the optimal value of the\\nsubproblems, dynamically inserting additional valid constraints, known as\\nBenders cuts. Most traditional implementations add a cut for each scenario\\n(multi-cut) or a single-cut that includes all scenarios. In this paper we\\npresent a novel Benders adaptive-cuts method, where the Benders cuts are\\naggregated according to a partition of the scenarios, which is dynamically\\nrefined using the LP-dual information of the subproblems. This scenario\\naggregation/disaggregation is based on the Generalized Adaptive Partitioning\\nMethod (GAPM), which has been successfully applied to TSSPs. We formalize this\\nhybridization of Benders decomposition and the GAPM, by providing sufficient\\nconditions under which an optimal solution of the deterministic equivalent can\\nbe obtained in a finite number of iterations. Our new method can be interpreted\\nas a compromise between the Benders single-cuts and multi-cuts methods, drawing\\non the advantages of both sides, by rendering the initial iterations faster (as\\nfor the single-cuts Benders) and ensuring the overall faster convergence (as\\nfor the multi-cuts Benders). Computational experiments on two stochastic\\nnetwork flow problems validate these statements, showing that the new method\\noutperforms the other implementations of Benders method, as well as other\\nstandard methods for solving TSSPs, in particular when the number of scenarios\\nis very large.',\n",

In the current\\nliterature, it is assumed that the long-term statistical knowledge of all user\\nchannels is available.
